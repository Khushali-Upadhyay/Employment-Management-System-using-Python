    "The task is to create a Database-driven Employee Management System in Python that will store the information in the MySQL Database. The script will contain the following operations :\n",

    "The idea is that we perform different changes in our Employee Record by using different functions for example the Add_Employee will insert a new row in our Employee, also, we will create a Remove Employee Function which will delete the record of any particular existing employee in our Employee table. This System works on the concepts of taking the information from the database making required changes in the fetched data and applying the changes in the record which we will see in our Promote Employee System. We can also have the information about all the existing employees by using the Display Employee function. The main advantage of connecting our program to the database is that the information becomes lossless even after closing our program a number of times."

For checking this it uses cursor.rowcount() function which counts the number of rows that match with given details. It is a utility function, and we will see its use in later operations like Add employee function, etc.\n",

Now after getting all such details from the user of that system it simply inserts the information in our Employee details table.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Remove Employee Function\n",
    "\n",
    "The Remove Employee Function will simply ask for Id of the employee to be removed because Id is Primary key in our Employee Details Record as there can be two employees with the same name, but they must have a unique id. The Remove Employee function uses the check employee function to check whether the employee to be removed exists in our record or not if employee details exist then after getting a valid employee id it deletes the record corresponding to that employee id.\n",

    "# Promote Employee Function\n",
